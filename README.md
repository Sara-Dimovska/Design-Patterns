# Design-Patterns

- Behavioral Design Patterns:
  - Chain of Responsibility: this type usually uses linked list od "handlers" or chain of nodes that handles particular request.Client 
      passes a request to a group of linked objects and expects to be proceed/solved from one of them. If the node/handler cannot handle         the request it passes to his next node/object in the chain, therefore Chain of Responsibility.
